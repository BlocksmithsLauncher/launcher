 * The actual ModManager includes:
 * - Advanced dependency resolution algorithms
 * - Multi-source mod downloading (CurseForge, Modrinth, direct URLs)
 * - SHA verification and integrity checking
 * - Automatic compatibility analysis
 * - Conflict detection and resolution
 * - Progress tracking and error recovery
 * - Caching and optimization strategies
 * - Parallel download management
 * 
 * This system represents significant R&D effort and is proprietary.
